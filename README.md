# AgriShield - Modern Farming Solutions

AgriShield is an advanced AI-powered system designed to predict and manage crop diseases, helping farmers make proactive, data-driven decisions for crop health. By integrating machine learning with IoT and satellite data, AgriShield provides real-time insights and actionable recommendations to prevent disease spread, optimize irrigation, and improve overall farm management.

This project was created as part of the Smart India Hackathon 2024 under the Agriculture, FoodTech, and Rural Development theme.
